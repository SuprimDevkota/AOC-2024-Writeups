## Introduction
This task covers a theoretical room that focuses on introducing governance, risk and compliance. **GRC** is a framework or integrated approach that organizations use to align their IT and business strategies with regulatory requirements, manage risks effectively and ensure that business processes are carried out ethically and efficiently.

- **Governance** is the function that creates the framework that an organization uses to make decisions regarding information security by establishing security strategies and policies and defining roles and responsibilities that everyone in the organization has to play to help ensure these security standards are met.

- **Risk** is a function that helps identify, assess, quantify and mitigate risk to the organization's IT assets and reduces the overall risk to an acceptable level and develop contingency plans in the event of a cyber attack where risk is realized.

- **Compliance** is the function that ensures that the organization adheres to all external legal, regulatory and industry standards.

## Walkthrough

### Task 15: Nine o'clock, make GRC fun, tell no one.

  - **Steps Taken:** The answer is obvious given the context.

#### Sub-Question: What is the flag you receive after performing the risk assessment?

  - **Steps Taken:** After completing the risk assessment and filling in the risk register of the three companies, we select the one with the lowest score to find the flag.

## Lessons Learned
- Learned about the various functions of GRC and how they work together to ensure that an organization meets its internal standards, manages risk to an acceptable level and adheres to compliance requirements of the industry or governing body.

- Learned how risk impact and risk likelihood fit together to compute a risk score that can then be compared between various third-party options allowing the choice with the least risk to be selected.
